 <p>Hitting the sandy shores of the Pacific Northwest is unlike a usual day at the beach elsewhere.
   Think rugged coastlines, moody weather, typically cooler temperatures, abundant sea and wildlife,
   and in many cases, a slower, small town vibe. Like many coastal destinations, these beaches tend
   to be busier during summer months, but come fall, the crowds go home and a quieter waterfront
   respite can be had.</p>

 <p>Damon Point Beach at Ocean Shores is one of my favorite beaches to explore. Walk out toward the
   last half mile you wil find gravel beds. This is a good spot to locate agates. Many  will say that
   the Oregon coast has much better agate pickings and you’ll be right. From my perspective, however,
   this beach is my best spot to find agates on the Washington coast! Find a map of Damon Beach <a href=
